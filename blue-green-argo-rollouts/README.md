# Cloud Native Blue/Green Deployment Strategy using Argo Rollouts

## Introduction
A critical topic in `Cloud Native` applications is theÂ deployment strategy. We are no longer dealing with one monolithic application. We have several applications that have dependencies on each other and also have other dependencies like brokers or databases.
 
Applications have their own life cycle, so we should be able to execute independent Blue/Green deployment. All the applications and dependencies will not change their version at the same time.
 
Another important topic in the `Cloud Native` is `Continuous Delivery`. If we are going to have several applications doing Blue/Green deployment independently we have to automate it. We will use **Helm**, **Argo Rollouts**, **Openshift GitOps**, and of course **Red Hat Openshift** to help us.

[**Argo Rollouts**](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/) is a Kubernetes controller and set of CRDs which provide advanced deployment capabilities such as blue-green, canary, canary analysis, experimentation, and progressive delivery features to Kubernetes.
In this demo we are going to use blue-green capabilities.
 
**In the next steps we will see a real example of how to install, deploy and manage the life cycle of Cloud Native applications doing Blue/Green deployment using Argo Rollouts.**
 
If you want to know more about Blue/Green deployment please read [**Blue/Green Deployment**](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/tree/main/blue-green-pipeline#bluegreen-deployment)

Let's start with some theory...after it, we will have the **hands-on example**.
## Shop application
 
We are going to use very simple applications to test Blue/Green deployment. We have created two Quarkus applications `Products` and `Discounts`
 
![Shop Application](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/Shop.png)
 
`Products` call `Discounts` to get the product`s discount and expose an API with a list of products with its discounts.
 
## Shop Blue/Green
 
To achieve Blue/Green deployment with `Cloud Native` applications using **Argo Rollouts**, we have designed this architecture.

![Shop initial status](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/rollout-blue-green-step-0.png)
 
OpenShift Components - Online

- Routes and Services declared with the suffix -online
- Routes mapped only to the online services
- Services mapped to the rollout.
 
OpenShift Components - Offline

- Routes and Services declared with the suffix -offline
- Routes mapped only to the offline services
- Services mapped to the rollout

This is an example of products rollout manifest:
```yaml
  strategy:
    blueGreen:
      activeService: products-umbrella-online
      previewService: products-umbrella-offline      
      autoPromotionEnabled: false
      prePromotionAnalysis:
        templates:
          - templateName: products-analysis-template
```
 
We have defined an active or online service 'products-umbrella-online' and a preview or offline service 'products-umbrella-offline'. Final user will always use 'products-umbrella-online'. We have created an AnalysisTemplate 'products-analysis-template' that just validates the health of the application, for production environments a better analysis should be done. **Argo Rollouts** use this AnalysisTemplate to validate a new version and set it ready to be promoted or not. To learn more, please read [this](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/bluegreen/).
## Shop Umbrella Helm Chart
 
One of the best ways to package `Cloud Native` applications is `Helm`. In Blue/Green deployment it makes even more sense.
We have created a chart for each application that does not know anything about Blue/Green. Then we pack everything together in an umbrella helm chart.

![Shop Umbrella Helm Chart](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/Shop-helm-rollouts.png)

In the `Shop Umbrella Chart` we use several times the same charts as helm dependencies but with different names if they are online/offline. This will allow us to have different configurations for each color.
 
We have packaged both applications in one chart, but we may have different umbrella charts per application.
## Demo!!

### Prerequisites:

- **Red Hat Openshift 4.13** with admin rights.
  - You can download [Red Hat Openshift Local for OCP 4.13](https://developers.redhat.com/content-gateway/rest/mirror/pub/openshift-v4/clients/crc/2.6.0).
  - [Getting Started Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_local/2.5/html/getting_started_guide/using_gsg)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
- [oc 4.13 CLI] (https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html)
- [Argo Rollouts CLI](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/installation/#kubectl-plugin-installation )

We have a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies) for this demo. As part of the demo, you will have to do some changes and commits. So **it is important that you fork the repository and clone it in your local**.

```
git clone https://github.com/your_user/cloud-native-deployment-strategies
```

If we want to have a `Cloud Native` deployment we can not forget `CI/CD`. **Red Hat OpenShift GitOps** will help us.
 
### Install OpenShift GitOps
 
Go to the folder where you have cloned your forked repository and create a new branch `rollouts`
```
git checkout -b rollouts
git push origin rollouts
```
 
Log into OpenShift as a cluster admin and install the OpenShift GitOps operator with the following command. This may take some minutes.
```
oc apply -f gitops/gitops-operator.yaml
```
 
Once OpenShift GitOps is installed, an instance of Argo CD is automatically installed on the cluster in the `openshift-gitops` namespace and a link to this instance is added to the application launcher in OpenShift Web Console.
 
![Application Launcher](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/gitops-link.png)
 
### Log into Argo CD dashboard
 
Argo CD upon installation generates an initial admin password which is stored in a Kubernetes secret. In order to retrieve this password, run the following command to decrypt the admin password:
 
```
oc extract secret/openshift-gitops-cluster -n openshift-gitops --to=-
```
 
Click on Argo CD from the OpenShift Web Console application launcher and then log into Argo CD with `admin` username and the password retrieved from the previous step.
 
![Argo CD](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/ArgoCD-login.png)
 
![Argo CD](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/ArgoCD-UI.png)
 
### Configure OpenShift with Argo CD
 
We are going to follow, as much as we can, a GitOps methodology in this demo. So we will have everything in our Git repository and use **ArgoCD** to deploy it in the cluster.
 
In the current Git repository, the [gitops/cluster-config](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/tree/main/gitops/cluster-config) directory contains OpenShift cluster configurations such as:

- namespaces `gitops`.
- role binding for ArgoCD to the namespace `gitops`.
- namespaces `argo-rollouts`.
- Argo Rollouts `RolloutManager`.
 
Let's configure Argo CD to recursively sync the content of the [gitops/cluster-config](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/tree/main/gitops/cluster-config) directory into the OpenShift cluster.
 
Execute this command to add a new Argo CD application that syncs a Git repository containing cluster configurations with the OpenShift cluster.
 
```
oc apply -f blue-green-argo-rollouts/application-cluster-config.yaml
```
 
Looking at the Argo CD dashboard, you would notice that an application has been created.

You can click on the `cluster-configuration` application to check the details of sync resources and their status on the cluster.

### Create Shop application

We are going to create the application `shop`, that we will use to test Blue/Green deployment. Because we will make changes in the application's GitHub repository, we have to use the repository that you have just forked. Please edit the file `blue-green-argo-rollouts/application-shop-blue-green-rollouts.yaml` and set your own GitHub repository in the `reportURL`.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: shop
  namespace: openshift-gitops
spec:
  destination:
    name: ''
    namespace: gitops
    server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
  source:
    path: helm/quarkus-helm-umbrella/chart
    repoURL:  https://github.com/change_me/cloud-native-deployment-strategies.git
    targetRevision: rollouts
    helm:
      parameters:
      - name: "global.namespace"
        value: gitops
      valueFiles:
        - values/values-rollouts-blue-green.yaml
  project: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
```

```
oc apply -f blue-green-argo-rollouts/application-shop-blue-green-rollouts.yaml
```

Looking at the Argo CD dashboard, you would notice that we have a new `shop` application.

![Argo CD - Cluster Config](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/ArgoCD-Applications.png)

## Test Shop application
 
We have deployed the `shop` with ArgoCD. We can test that it is up and running.
 
We have to get the Online route
```
curl -k "$(oc get routes products-umbrella-online -n gitops --template='https://{{.spec.host}}')/products"
```
And the Offline route
```
curl -k "$(oc get routes products-umbrella-offline -n gitops --template='https://{{.spec.host}}')/products"
```
Notice that in each microservice response we have added metadata information to see better the `version` of each application. This will help us to see the changes while we do the Blue/Green deployment.
Because right now we have both routers against the same rollout revision we will have the same response with version `v1.0.1`:
```json
{
   "products":[
      {
         ...
         "name":"TV 4K",
         "price":"1500â¬"
      }
   ],
   "metadata":{
      "version":"v1.0.1", <--
      "colour":"none",
      "mode":"online"
   }
}
```

We can also see the rollout`s status[^note].

[^note]:
    Argo Rollouts offers a Kubectl plugin to enrich the experience with Rollouts https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/installation/#kubectl-plugin-installation 

```
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout products --watch -n gitops
```

```

      ââââ¡ products-67fc9fb79b-p7jk9  Pod         â Running  12m  ready:1/1
```

 
## Products Blue/Green deployment
 
We have split a `Cloud Native` Blue/Green deployment into two steps:

1. Deploy a new version.
2. Promote a new version
 

 
We have already deployed the products version v1.0.1, and we are ready to use a new products version v1.1.1 that has a new `description` attribute.

This is our current status:
![Shop initial status](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/rollout-blue-green-step-0.png)
### Step 1 - Deploy a new version
 
We will deploy a new version v1.1.1. To do it, we have to edit the file `helm/quarkus-helm-umbrella/chart/values/values-rollouts-blue-green.yaml` under `products-blue` set `tag` value to `v.1.1.1`

```yaml
products-blue:
  mode: online
  image:
    tag: v1.1.1
```

And push the changes
```
git add .
git commit -m "Change products version to v1.1.1"
git push origin rollouts
```

 ArgoCD will refresh the status after some minutes. If you don't want to wait you can refresh it manually from ArgoCD UI or configure the Argo CD Git Webhook.[^note2].
 
[^note2]:
    Here you can see how to configure the Argo CD Git [Webhook]( https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/webhook/)
    ![Argo CD Git Webhook](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/ArgoCD-webhook.png)


![Refresh Shop](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/ArgoCD-Shop-Refresh.png)
 
**Argo Rollouts** will automatically deploy the new products version and execute the `prePromotionAnalysis`. 

```
NAME                                  KIND         STATUS        AGE  INFO
â³ products                            Rollout      à¥¥ Paused      27m

âââ# revision:1

      ââââ¡ products-67fc9fb79b-49k25  Pod          â Running     27m  ready:1/1
      ââââ¡ products-67fc9fb79b-p7jk9  Pod          â Running     27m  ready:1/1
```
  
If the `prePromotionAnalysis` goes well, we can see that offline applications have version v1.1.1 and the new attribute description, but the online version has not changed.

This is our current status:
![Shop Step 1](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/rollout-blue-green-step-1.png)

 
```json
{
  "products":[
     {
        "discountInfo":{...},
        "name":"TV 4K",
        "price":"1500â¬",
        "description":"The best TV" <--
     }
  ],
  "metadata":{
     "version":"v1.1.1", <--
  }
}
```
Functional testing users can execute `Smoke tests` to validate this new v1.1.1 version.

We have to be careful with those tests in a production environment because the product microservice will call the online dependencies.
If this dependency is for example a production DB we will create the things that our `Smoke tests` do.
 
### Step 2 - Promote a new version
 
We are going to open the new version to final users.

Execute this command to promote products:
```
kubectl argo rollouts promote products -n gitops
```

First **Argo Rollouts** will just change the service to use the new release (ReplicaSet). We `minimize downtime` because it just changes the service label. 

```
NAME                                  KIND         STATUS        AGE  INFO
â³ products                            Rollout      â Healthy     88m  
âââ# revision:2

â  âââÎ± products-9dc6f576f-2-pre      AnalysisRun  â Successful  62m  â 1
âââ# revision:1

      ââââ¡ products-67fc9fb79b-p7jk9  Pod          â Running     88m  ready:1/1
```
This is our current status:
![Shop Step 2 initial](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/rollout-blue-green-step-2-initial.png)

And after `scaleDownDelaySeconds` **Argo Rollouts** will scale down the first replicaSet (v1.0.1).
 
```

   ââââ§ products-67fc9fb79b          ReplicaSet   â¢ ScaledDown  89m  
```

This is our final status:
![Shop Step 2](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/rollout-blue-green-step-2.png)

**We have in the online environment the new version v1.1.1!!!**
```json
{
  "products":[
     {
        "discountInfo":{...},
        "name":"TV 4K",
        "price":"1500â¬",
        "description":"The best TV" <--
     }
  ],
  "metadata":{
     "version":"v1.1.1", <--
  }
}
```

### Rollback

Imagine that something goes wrong, we know that this never happens but just in case. We can do a very `quick rollback` just undoing the change in the `Products` online service.

**Argo Rollouts** has an [undo](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/generated/kubectl-argo-rollouts/kubectl-argo-rollouts_undo/) command to do the rollback. In my opinion, I don't like this procedure because it is not aligned with GitOps. The changes that **Argo Rollouts** do does not come from git, so git is OutOfSync with what we have in Openshift.
In our case the commit that we have done not only changes the ReplicaSet but also the ConfigMap. The `undo` command only changes the ReplicaSet, so it does not work for us.

I recommend doing the changes in git. We will revert the last commit
```
git revert HEAD
git push origin rollouts
```
**ArgoCD** will get the changes and apply them. **Argo Rollouts** will create a new revision with the previous version.

![Shop Step Rollback initial](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/rollout-blue-green-step-rollback-initial.png)

Execute this command to promote products to version `v1.0.1`:
```
kubectl argo rollouts promote products -n gitops
```
The rollback is done!
![Shop Step Rollback](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/rollout-blue-green-step-rollback.png)
```json
{
   "products":[
      {
         ...
         "name":"TV 4K",
         "price":"1500â¬"
      }
   ],
   "metadata":{
      "version":"v1.0.1", <--
      "colour":"none",
      "mode":"online"
   }
}
```
## Delete environment
 
To delete all the things that we have done for the demo you have to:

- In GitHub delete the branch `rollouts`
- In ArgoCD delete the application `cluster-configuration` and `shop`
- In Openshift, go to project `openshift-operators` and delete the installed operators **Openshift GitOps**.
